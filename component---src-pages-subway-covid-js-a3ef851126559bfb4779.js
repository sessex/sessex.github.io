The stations can be identified by their unique Unit code, which allowed for cross-matching with a dataset of geographic coordinates. After cleaning, aggregating, and re-formatting the data using Python + Pandas, the final dataset consisted of monthly subway entries for each station with the station's corresponding longitude and latitude. This same process was repeated for daily entries in March, the ___ of the COVID-19 crisis in NYC, to allow for a deeper look at COVID-19 related events.

Each station is plotted and users can explore the dataset using timeline filters and interacting with the map of NYC. USers can observe the data at a glance, filtering by month, or for a more detailed view, filtering by days in March. The visualization specifically leverages the Mapbox clustering feature, grouping data points based on a maximum radius specification. Depending on zoom level, the clusters sum the number of entries of the stations included within the radius. Users can compare subway usage between different areas of the metropolitan area or zoom in close to observe changes of individual stations.
